# Text-to-Image Generation with ControlNet Conditioning

## Overview

[T2I-Adapter: Learning Adapters to Dig out More Controllable Ability for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08453) by Chong Mou, Xintao Wang, Liangbin Xie, Jian Zhang, Zhongang Qi, Ying Shan, Xiaohu Qie.

Using the pretrained models we can provide control images (for example, a depth map) to control Stable Diffusion text-to-image generation so that it follows the structure of the depth image and fills in the details.

The abstract of the paper is the following:

*The incredible generative ability of large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated strong power of learning complex structures and meaningful semantics. However, relying solely on text prompts cannot fully take advantage of the knowledge learned by the model, especially when flexible and accurate structure control is needed. In this paper, we aim to ``dig out" the capabilities that T2I models have implicitly learned, and then explicitly use them to control the generation more granularly. Specifically, we propose to learn simple and small T2I-Adapters to align internal knowledge in T2I models with external control signals, while freezing the original large T2I models. In this way, we can train various adapters according to different conditions, and achieve rich control and editing effects. Further, the proposed T2I-Adapters have attractive properties of practical value, such as composability and generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T2I-Adapter has promising generation quality and a wide range of applications.*

## Difference with ControlNet

Foundatly T2I-Adapter is try to achieve the same goal as ControlNet with simliar approch, the main difference between the two is:
1.	Unlike ControlNet which "fork" the enitre UNet to process conditioning signal, T2I-Adapter use a network that is much smaller than UNet. So Adapter will have a shorter training time, smaller model size but slighly lower image quality.
2. 


## Available Pipelines:

## Usage example

In the following we give a simple example of how to use a *ControlNet* checkpoint with Diffusers for inference.
The inference pipeline is the same for all pipelines:

* 1. Take an image and run it through a pre-conditioning processor.
* 2. Run the pre-processed image through the [`StableDiffusionAdapterPipeline`].

Let's have a look at a simple example using the [Canny Edge ControlNet](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny).

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionAdapterPipeline
from diffusers.utils import load_image

# Let's load the popular vermeer image
image = load_image(
    "https://hf.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/input_image_vermeer.png"
)
```

![img](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/input_image_vermeer.png)


Then we can retrieve the canny edges of the image.

```python
import cv2
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

image = np.array(image)

low_threshold = 100
high_threshold = 200

image = cv2.Canny(image, low_threshold, high_threshold)
image = image[:, :, None]
image = np.concatenate([image, image, image], axis=2)
canny_image = Image.fromarray(image)
```

Let's take a look at the processed image.

![img](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/vermeer_canny_edged.png)


```py

```


```py
generator = torch.manual_seed(0)

out_image = pipe(
    "disco dancer with colorful lights", num_inference_steps=20, generator=generator, image=canny_image
).images[0]
```

This should take only around 3-4 seconds on GPU (depending on hardware). The output image then looks as follows:

**Note**: To see how to run all other ControlNet checkpoints, please have a look at [ControlNet with Stable Diffusion 1.5](#controlnet-with-stable-diffusion-1.5)

<!-- TODO: add space -->

## Available checkpoints

Adapter requires a *control image* in addition to the text-to-image *prompt*. 
Each pretrained model is trained using a different conditioning method that requires different images for conditioning the generated outputs. For example, Canny edge conditioning requires the control image to be the output of a Canny filter, while depth conditioning requires the control image to be a depth map. See the overview and image examples below to know more.

All checkpoints can be found under the authors' namespace [lllyasviel](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel).
